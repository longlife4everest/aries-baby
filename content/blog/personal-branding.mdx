# Building My Personal Brand

As an Information Systems student, I realized that technical skills alone aren't enough. We need to communicate our value. That's why I started **AriesBaby** - a project to showcase my journey, skills, and passion for systems and data.

## Why Branding Matters

In the tech industry, your portfolio is your identity. It's not just about what you know, but what you can build and how you solve problems.

## The Tech Stack

I chose to build this website using:
- **Next.js 14**: For performance and SEO.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid and beautiful styling.
- **Framer Motion**: To add life with animations.

This project represents my growth from learning basic coding usage to building production-ready applications.

## What's Next?

I plan to document my learning journey in Data Analytics and System Analysis here. Stay tuned!
